# DSTU2

All models required to build DSTU2 resources and datatypes are housed here.
This includes Java models for all DSTU2 supported resources (below), and all needed datatypes.
Also includes the appropriate tests for each Java model.

Because validation logic is shared among all FHIR versions, it has been pulled out into its own module.
