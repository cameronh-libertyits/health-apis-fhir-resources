# health-apis-fhir-resources

This repository will create a shared source for all of the FHIR resources and datatypes we currently support.
Resources are divided into modules by version. Currently this only includes R4, but will expand to include: Argonaut, DSTU2, and STU3.
Datatypes and tests specific to the FHIR version are to be included in their respective module.
